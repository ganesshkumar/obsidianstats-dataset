# ObsidianStats Dataset

This project is a collection of dataset that are related to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Background

While building and maintaining [ObsidianStats](https://www.obsidianstats.com), I started to collect some dataset related to the Obsidian's plugin ecosystem. I decided to public the dataset publicly to benefit others who are interested in studying Obsidian's plugin ecosystem, creating related projects, or simply exploring how plugins have evolved over time.
